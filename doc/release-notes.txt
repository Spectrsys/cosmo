The Chandler Project is pleased to announce the 1.1.0 release of Chandler Server (Cosmo)!

Chandler Server is a server and Ajax web UI for managing and sharing calendars, events, and tasks. It implements open data standards including CalDAV, WebDAV, Atom, and Atompub.

This release contains two significant features and four bug fixes.  Any user can now delete their own account and data by using the settings dialog.  Interoperability with some CalDAV implementations including iCal 3 should be improved by support for the CTAG draft standard.

Chandler Server 1.1.0 is available for download as a ready-to-run bundle at:

http://chandlerproject.org/serverdownload

and the source code is available from subversion at:

http://svn.osafoundation.org/server/cosmo/tags/rel_1.1.0
