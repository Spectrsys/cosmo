/**
 * The ScoobyService is the place where all client/server communcations are
 * brokered. The methods here are all empty because the intent is that you
 * can have different implementations for different types of RPC (eg. JSON-RPC, XML-RPC.)
 * Whichever implementation is loaded will replace the methods here with concrete implementations.
 *
 * All methods here can be called two ways - synchronously or asynchronously. For synchcronous
 * calls just call them method as declared below. For example:
 *
 *    <code> var events = scoobyService.getEvents("Cosmo", beginDate, endDate);</code>
 *
 * For asynchronous calls you simply pass a callback as the first argument to any of the methods.
 * The callback is of the form
 *
 *    <code>function callback(result, exception)</code>
 *
 * Note that for synchronous calls exceptions are thrown, while for asynch calls they are simply
 * passed to the callback. In other words, for asycnh calls you don't catch exceptions, just check
 * for the presence of an exception. If it's not null, a problem occured.
