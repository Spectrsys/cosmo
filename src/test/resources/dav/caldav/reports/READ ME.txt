Test Suite for Cosmo CalDAV report testing.

Requirements
____________

*Cosmo 0.3+ server

*Test account on server with:

	user id:  'test'
	password: 'test1'

*Create new calendar for user test:

	MKCALENDAR /cosmo/home/test/calendars/temp/


Testing Procedure
_________________

* Testing is done by telnet'ing to the server and pasting in the test's
request data from the appropriate file.

* A set of calendar resource to store on the server is available in the
put directory. Each xxx.txt file contains a PUT request to initialise
the iCal data needed for report testing on the server. Each of the PUT's
stores a resource with the name 1.ics, 2.ics etc.

* Each test suite consists of a set of xxx.txt data files that contain
the REPORT requests that are used for actual testing

* The current set of test suites are:

	- multiget			: multiget reports (used for testing various
calendar-data element variants too)
	- basicquery		: basic text queries
	- timerangequery	: time-range queries
	- freebusy			: free busy reports
	- limitexpand		: queries using limit/expand recurrence
	
* The xxx.txt requests should all be executed first, then each xxx.txt
request run with verification of the response of each

Resources

6.txt: recurring VEVENT (5 consecutive days, one exception), summary
