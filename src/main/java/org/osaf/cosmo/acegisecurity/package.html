Provides utilities and implementation classes for integrating the
Acegi Security System for Spring into Cosmo.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
This package provides two types of classes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Servlet filters that control the instantiation and behavior of
  various Acegi Security framework components</li>
<li>Services that use Cosmo data access objects to adapt the Cosmo
  model to the Acegi Security model</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>ticket</code> and <code>homedir</code> subpackages contain
classes that together implement Cosmo's custom authentication and
authorization schemes.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo defers to Acegi Security's role-based security implementation
for access control for administrators.
