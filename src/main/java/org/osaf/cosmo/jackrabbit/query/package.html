Provides a Jackrabbit implementation of an extension to the JCR XPath
query syntax to support timerange queries.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>
JCR specifies an XPath syntax for querying repository data, but the
syntax is not expressive enough for CalDAV time-range tests. This
package implements an extension to the XPath query syntax that
includes a timerange function.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> In a future version of Cosmo,
<code>TextCalendarTextFilter</code> will be removed and the remaining
JCR and Jackrabbit extensions will be migrated into Jackrabbit
itself.
</p>
