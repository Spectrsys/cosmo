<h2>Overview</h2>
<h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 has four primary
goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Support for Chandler 0.6
sharing features</li>
  <li>An interface for end users
to sign up for and manage their own accounts</li>
  <li>Basic standards-based
interoperability with calendar clients other than Chandler</li>
  <li>Windows platform support</li>
</ol>

</dl>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span></h3>
<p>The initial version of Cosmo
focused on securely providing basic sharing support for multiple users
in a single repository. Sharing in Cosmo 0.1 is performed solely by
WebDAV; there are no calendar-specific features. A user can synchronize
synchronize a collection across multiple instances of Chandler by
storing opaque data files in the user's Cosmo home directory. However,
Cosmo 0.1 does not provide a mechanism for allowing a second user to
view or edit the collection.</p>
<p>In Cosmo 0.1, an administrator
has to log into the "admin console" web user interface to provision an
account for an end user and then email or otherwise communicate the
account details to the user. This is a significant barrier to usage of
Chandler's sharing and synchronization features, especially considering
that OSAF (and perhaps other organizations) will in the future host a
public Cosmo server for users who are not part of a workgroup with a
dedicated Cosmo installation and administrator.</p>
<p>One of the primary goals for
the eventual Cosmo 1.0 is interoperability with standards-based
calendar clients via CalDAV. A staged approach toward CalDAV
implementation allows the realization of primary interoperability use
cases in early Cosmo and Chandler versions. Furthermore, Cosmo should
make some allowance for widely-used clients that have not yet embraced
CalDAV, such as Apple's iCal, which uses the "first generation"
technique
of publishing and subscribing to monolithic iCalendar resources
(events, timezones, and calendar bundled into a single WebDAV resource)
rather than the single-iCalendar-object-per-resource approach of CalDAV.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Chandler user attempts to
share his calendar for the first
time. Lacking a WebDAV account, he is given a link to a Cosmo web page
where he can sign up for an account.</li>
  <li>A user is entering WebDAV
information for an existing Cosmo
account into a Chandler installation on a second computer, but he has
forgotten his username.</li>
  <li>A user is entering WebDAV
information for an existing Cosmo
account into a Chandler installation on a second computer, but he has
forgotten his password.</li>
  <li>A user changes his username,
email address, and/or password via a
Cosmo web page.</li>
  <li>A Chandler user shares a
calendar with a set of friends who also
use Chandler. Some of the friends are allowed to update the calendar,
while the others can only view the calendar.</li>
  <li>A Chandler user shares a
calendar with a friend who subscribes to
it with iCal.</li>
  <li>A Chandler user subscribes
to a calendar published by a friend
who uses iCal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<h4>Tickets</h4>
<p>Cosmo must accept a ticket
specified in the URL of a WebDAV resource
in preference to other authentication schemes and access control
procedures (e.g. Basic authentication, ACL-based authorization) as
per&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Ticket-Based Access
Control
Extension
to WebDAV</span> (see link at
bottom).</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calendar content
negotiation</span></h4>
<p> Cosmo must be able to provide
varying views of a calendar collection or resource based on the
requesting client. iCal expects to GET, PUT and DELETE monolithic
iCalendar resources containing the calendar and all constituent events
and timezones. It does not understand the notion of a calendar
collection. A CalDAV client expects to use MKCALENDAR to create a
calendar collection, PROPFIND to list the calendar resources within the
collection (ignoring any non-calendar resources), and GET, PUT and
DELETE to manage each individual resource. Cosmo must support all of
these access methods for any given calendar. It must be able to convert
a monolithic iCalendar request resource into a calendar collection
containing individual calendar resources, and it must be able to
generate a monolithic iCalendar view of a calendar collection.
</p>
<h4>iCalendar awareness<br />
</h4>
<p>Cosmo must be able to store iCalendar calendar and event objects in
its repository in such a way as to facilitate CalDAV queries, even
though those queries are not supported by this version of Cosmo.
Addressing this requirement eliminates a significant risk early in
Cosmo's development (that of not knowing how much effort it will take
to make the repository aware of calendar content) and reduces the
amount of data migration necessary when upgrading to future versions.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chandler share data</span></h4>
<p>Cosmo must allow Chandler to
store arbitrary data files within a calendar collection. When sharing
an ItemCollection, Chandler will create a calendar collection in the
user's home directory to contain iCalendar resources and beneath that a
regular collection to contain the shared ContentItems in Chandler's
internal format. Cosmo does not have to understand the names or formats
of any of the resources within the subcollection. The subcollection
itself does not have to follow any particular naming policy; because
CalDAV specifies that calendar collections may not contain other
calendar collections, Cosmo can ignore any subcollections of a calendar
collection when generating an iCalendar view of a calendar collection.</p>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cosmo will defer support for
the CalDAV server timezone
collection, ticket timeouts and ticket usage limits to a later version.</li>
  <li>Tickets do not necessarily
represent unique individuals; a ticket
can be given to and used by multiple persons.</li>
  <li>Tickets will never be used
to access the web user interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3>High-level Decisions</h3>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 will not support any
mechanisms for controlling access to
a user's home directory by another user other than tickets. A future
version will allow
a user to assign permissions on his home directory to other users
(probably only on the same server) via WebDAV ACL and a web user
interface.</p>
<p>Chandler 0.6 will provide a
link to a Cosmo account signup page
whenever a user is prompted to enter WebDAV account information. A
future version will support a Cosmo API for automated account creation.</p>
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Calendar collection</dt>
  <dd>A WebDAV collection that
advertises to clients that it may
contain calendar resources; may contain non-calendar resources and
collections but may not contain calendar collections.</dd>
  <dt>ContentItem</dt>
  <dd>A piece of information
stored by Chandler such as a calendar,
event, or email message; not shareable itself, only as part of an
ItemCollection</dd>
  <dt>Individual iCalendar resource</dt>
  <dd>An HTTP resource containing
an iCalendar representation of a
single calendar object (calendar, event, or timezone)</dd>
  <dt>ItemCollection</dt>
  <dd>A group of Chandler
ContentItems that can be shared between
Chandler users; the fundamental unit of sharing for Chandler</dd>
  <dt>Monolithic iCalendar resource</dt>
  <dd>An HTTP resource containing
an iCalendar representation of a
calendar and its constituent events and timezones<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span></dd>
  <dt>WebDAV collection</dt>
  <dd>A resource on a WebDAV
server that can contain other resources;
roughly equivalent to a directory or folder in a file system</dd>
</dl>
<h2>User Interface / Interaction</h2>
<h3>Account Signup</h3>
<p>This page has a form with these
fields:</p>
<ul>
  <li>username (required, must be
unique, 3-32 chars long, legal chars
are letters, numbers, underscores, spaces, periods, hyphens,
apostrophes)</li>
  <li>email address (required,
1-32 chars long)</li>
  <li>password (required, 5-16
chars long)</li>
  <li>password confirmation
(required, must match password)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="issue">Should we also capture the user's first
and last
name? Any other fields? What are the rules for those fields (required,
min/max length, legal syntax, etc)? How would capturing this
information affect external authentication?</span></p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the input.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If validation fails, the
form is redisplayed including a message
for each error</li>
  <li>Otherwise the server creates
the account, sends a confirmation
email to the specified address, logs in the user and displays the
Welcome Page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Account Management</h3>
<p>This page has a form with the
same fields as on the Account Signup
page. The validation rules are slightly different in that the password
and confirmation are not required if the password is not being changed
(but both are required if the password is being changed).</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the input.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If validation fails, the
form is redisplayed including a message
for each error.</li>
  <li>Otherwise the server updates
the account and redisplays the
Account Management Page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Forgotten Username</h3>
<p>This page has a form containing
a single email address field.</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the given address.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an account does not exist
with the address, the form is
redisplayed including an error message.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the server sends
an email to the address containing
the username of the associated account and redisplays the Login Page.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="issue">What happens if multiple accounts use
the given
email address?</span></p>
<h3>Forgotten Password</h3>
<p>This page has a form containing
a single username field.</p>
<p>When the form is submitted, the
server validates the given username.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If an account does not exist
with the username, the form is
redisplayed including an error message.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the server sends
an email containing the password of the associated account to the
account's address and redisplays the Login Page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protocol Interactions</h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tickets</span></h3>
<p>Cosmo will implement the
MKTICKET
and DELTICKET methods defined in&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Ticket-Based
Access Control Extension
to WebDAV</span> (see link at
bottom). Ticket discovery is not
required,
since Chandler will remember any generated tickets. Chandler-generated
tickets will never have timeouts or use limits.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">CalDAV</span></h3>
<p>Cosmo will implement
individually-addressable calendar objects and the MKCALENDAR method as
per&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Calendaring Extensions to
WebDAV (CalDAV)</span> (see
link at bottom).</p>
<h2>Special Considerations</h2>
<h3>QA / Test</h3>
<p>Cosmo will provide a full suite
of unit and integration tests for
every subsystem so that QA can focus on functional and security
testing. This should involve verifying the behaviors described in the
"User Interface/Interaction" section above and attempting to compromise
the system (see "Security" below).</p>
<p>As we do not have any explicit
performance or scalability goals at
this time, tests in those areas should probably be limited to
establishing a baseline which can be used to compare the qualities of
successive versions.</p>
<h3>API / Developer Platform</h3>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 will not support any
external APIs.<br />
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>Historically many web sites and
applications have been susceptible
to URL hacking, SQL injection, cross site scripting, and similar
attacks. A professional web application in 2005 has no excuse for these
sorts of vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Other security concerns include
verifying that a generated ticket
has exactly the requested set of permissions (read or read/write) on
the associated resource only (the ticket should not allow access to any
other resource) and assuring that the tickets cannot be forged or
spoofed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the ticket scheme
is inherently insecure, even more so
due to Chandler 0.6's policy of using non-expiring, infinite-use
tickets. This means that a ticket-bearing URL placed on a web page
could be indexed by Google, for instance, making the ticketed resource
available to the world at large. The only way to guarantee the security
of a ticket in a sharing notification is by exchanging the URL in a
fully encrypted fashion (via S/MIME, for example) and not exposing it
to unauthorized or untrusted clients.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chandler 0.5 does
not support WebDAV over SSL, so
tickets are exposed as soon as they are generated by the server and
sent to the client.</p>
<p class="issue">It is
unknown if Chandler 0.6 will support WebDAV
over SSL. If so, Cosmo 0.2 will likely require SSL for all connections
(HTTP, WebDAV, CalDAV).</p>
<p>Cosmo 0.2 will only support
Basic and ticket authentication. A
future version will add Digest support in preference to Basic.</p>
<h3>Internationalization /
Localization</h3>
<p>JSTL and Java message resource
bundles will be used to provide an
internationalized web user interface. The web interface will be
designed to be as locale-independent as possible (avoiding intermixing
widgets and text, using coarse-grained message resources, etc). The
only shipped localization will be US English, but we will obviously
accept localizations in this area.</p>
<p>Exceptions and other messages
written to the Cosmo logs will be in
US English. There are no plans to provide localized log messages in
future versions of Cosmo, although we are open to debate on this issue.</p>
<p>Questions of
internationalization of the data stored in the Cosmo
repository are deferred to a later version.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Not enough is known about web
user interface accessibility at this
time. It is anticipated that future versions of Cosmo will provide
keyboard shortcuts and utilize other XHTML accessibility mechanisms as
appropriate. Community discussions on this topic are welcomed.</p>
<h3>Build / Install</h3>
<p>Cosmo's build system will be
migrated from Ant to Maven, and the source code will be moved from CVS
to Subversion.</p>
