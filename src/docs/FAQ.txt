BUILDING
========

Q: Wow, the build seems to be downloading a lot of jars. Is that
   normal?

    A: Yes. Cosmo has a lot of external dependencies, which is why we
       use the Ant Tasks for Maven to manage them. The jars only need
       to be downloaded the first time you build though, and
       afterwards only when we update our dependencies.

Q: Where did all those downloaded jars go?

    A: In your Maven2 repository at ~/.m2/repository.

Q: Why is the building downloading JUnit if I already installed it?

    A: One of the jars we depend on has its own dependency on JUnit,
       so Maven sucks it down into your local repository (see previous
       question). Our build doesn't look there for JUnit though; it
       expects you to have installed JUnit in your $ANT_HOME/lib
       directory. This has the additional benefit of allowing you to
       use JUnit for projects other than Cosmo.

Q: When running 'ant build', why do I get the error
   "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/tools/ant/types/FileList$FileName"?

    A: You are using an older version of Ant and need to upgrade to
       1.6.2 or later.


TESTING
=======

Q: Why do I have to run a separate ant command to set up the test
   database? Can't that be done automatically?

    A: No, because we're using HSQLDB in embedded mode, which means
       that the database is owned by a single process. To run our
       tests, Ant forks off a separate process for JUnit. If we used
       a single Ant command to set up the test db and run the tests,
       then the forked JUnit JVM would not be able to access the
       database.


DEPLOYMENT
==========

Q: Why are you using an RDBMS anyway?

    A: Because it was the easiest way to get up and running. We will
       migrate user and role info to JCR very soon (likely in
       0.2). This will simplify every stage of the process.
