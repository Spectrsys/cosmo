Cosmo Sharing Server 0.2.6
Release Notes
        

UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS RELEASE
=================================

If upgrading from 0.2.4 or later, no configuration changes are
required. Repositories created by 0.2.4 or later may be used by this
version with no changes.

Releases prior to 0.2.4 required Java 1.4, but starting with 0.2.4,
Cosmo now requires Java 5.0 (1.5).


NEW FEATURES
============

4045: The web console (formerly called WebUI) now lives at the URI
      /console. The root URI (/) forwards a user to the console's login
      page, or to the account page if the user is logged in.


BUGS FIXED
==========

4741: CMP and *DAV protocols ignore the web console's session so that
      their tickets cannot leak into the session and cause a session
      persistence problem when tomcat stops.
4820: CMP and *DAV ignore the web console's session so that cached
      authentication credentials from the session cannot leak into
      those protocols' security contexts and cause authentication or
      authorization errors.
4883: when filling out the forgotten username/password form, if the
      user enters an email address that is not found in the user
      database, show a friendly error message to that effect and a
      button that allows the user to sign up for a new account.
4888: CMP and *DAV protocols ignore the web console's session so that
      a client application can use multiple protocols with different
      credentials and consequently different server-side security
      contexts.
4891: when the SMTP server can't be contacted, show a friendly error
      message rather than a stack trace.
4899: the ticket:ticketdiscovery WebDAV property will never
      contains expired tickets.
4919: jackrabbit starts up successfully even with 1000+ users.
