Cosmo Sharing Server 0.2.7
Release Notes
        

UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS RELEASE
=================================

If upgrading from 0.2.4 or later, no configuration changes are
required. Repositories created by 0.2.4 or later may be used by this
version with no changes.

Releases prior to 0.2.4 required Java 1.4, but starting with 0.2.4,
Cosmo now requires Java 5.0 (1.5).

Accounts created in a 0.2.6 instance may have been corrupted due to
bug 5095. These accounts can be safely removed via CMP and the Web
Console.


NEW FEATURES
============

None.


BUGS FIXED
==========


5078: PUT requests must now provide a Content-Length header with a
      positive value unless the request specifies the chunked
      transfer-coding. Furthermore, Cosmo returns a 500 response if a
      Content-Length header is provided but it does not read that
      exact number of bytes for the request body.

5095: Home directory creation is now serialized to ensure that
      multiple signup requests do not cause concurrency failures.

5096: When a CMP request results in a 400 response, a warning is
      logged containing more information about the bad request.

5108: The Web Console now attempts to create a user when receiving a
      request for /console/user/create rather than generating a
      misleading error page.
