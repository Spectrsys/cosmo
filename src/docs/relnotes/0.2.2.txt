Cosmo Sharing Server 0.2.2
Release Notes
        

UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS RELEASE
=================================

Due to a change in the way that repository data is stored on disk,
0.2.2 cannot operate against repositories created by earlier versions
of Cosmo.


BUGS FIXED
==========

4350: Expanded timezone support provided by ical4j 0.9.17.
4388: The Content-Type response header is properly set when GETing
      collections.
4390: Temporary files are no longer used when creating the response
      contents for GET requests against collections, which should get
      rid of the "too many open files" error message seen in
      cosmo.log.
4521: The If-Match and If-None-Match headers are now supported for all
      HTTP methods.
4526: GET requests including If-Modified-Since headers now cause 304
      (Unmodified) responses as appropriate.
4527: The date value of the Last-Modified response header is now in
      the same timezone as the other date headers in the response.
4563: Unusually formatted timezones within PUT calendar objects are
      more robustly handled with ical4j 0.9.17.
4575: Intermittent failures making collections and PUTing resources
      are guarded against by using a filesystem storage scheme that
      does not run up against operating system limits for inode
      links.
