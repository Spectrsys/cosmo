TOMCAT BUNDLE
=============

In order to install and run Cosmo bundled with Tomcat, perform the
following steps:


(1) Download and install a Java Runtime Environment

    * Download a JRE release (version 1.4 or later) from:

        http://java.sun.com/j2se/

    * Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

    * Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the
      directory into which you installed the JDK release.


(2) Download and install the Cosmo binary distribution

    NOTE: As an alternative to downloading a binary distribution, you
    can create your own from the source repository, as described in
    BUILD.txt.  If you do this, the release directory will be created
    inside the "dist" directory of the source distribution.

    * Download a binary distribution from:

        http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/CosmoTempHome

    * Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so
      that the distribution resides in its own directory
      (conventionally named cosmo-0.2).  For the purposes of
      the remainder of this document, the symbolic name
      "$COSMO_HOME" is used to refer to the full pathname of the
      release directory.


(3) Configure SSL (OPTIONAL)

    * Create a certificate keystore by executing the following
      command as the user which will run Cosmo, specifying
      a password value of "osafcosmo" for both the keystore password
      and the key (certificate) password:

        Unix:

        $JAVA_HOME/bin/keytool -genkey -alias osafcosmo -keyalg RSA

        Windows:

        -- not yet supported --

    * Uncomment the SSL Connector entry in
      $COSMO_HOME/tomcat/conf/server.xml:

        <Connector port="8443" enableLookups="false" secure="true"
                   scheme="https" clientAuth="want"
                   keystorePass="osafcosmo"/>

    For more information on creating a keystore, importing an
    existing certificates into a keystore, and configuring the SSL
    connector in Tomcat, see:

        http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/ssl-howto.html


(4) Start Cosmo

    Cosmo can be started by executing the following command:

        Unix:

        $COSMO_HOME/bin/cosmoctl start

        Windows:

        -- not yet supported --

    Cosmo's data store contains:

        data/db                       the embedded HSQLDB database for
                                      users and roles
        data/repository               the Jackrabbit content repository

    Cosmo writes the following log files:

        logs/cosmo.log                log output from Cosmo webapp and most
                                      Tomcat components
        logs/access.YYYY-MM-DD.log    HTTP access log (configured in
                                      tomcat/conf/Cataalina/localhost/cosmo.xml)
        tomcat/logs/catalina.out      Tomcat startup notices and other info
                                      it sends to STDOUT

    cosmo.log is rotated when the file reaches 1000KB in size. One
    old log will be maintained (with the ".1" suffix). This
    configuration can be modified by editing *both*
    $COSMO_HOME/tomcat/common/classes/log4j.xml and
    $COSMO_HOME/tomcat/webapps/cosmo/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.xml. The
    appender configurations for these files should match exactly; the
    results of not doing so are undetermined. See
    <http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/> for more information on
    Log4j configuration.

    The access log is rotated at midnight each night. Old logs are not
    cleaned up. This configuration can be modified by editing
    $COSMO_HOME/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/cosmo.xml. See
    <http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/config/valve.html>
    for more information on Tomcat Access Log Valve configuration.

    catalina.out is not rotated. It simply captures STDOUT output for
    the Tomcat java process. It will very rarely contain anything
    other than Tomcat startup notices.


(5) Use Cosmo

    After startup, the server's welcome page is viewable at
    (username 'root', password 'cosmo'):

        http://localhost:8080/
        https://localhost:8443/                (if you enabled SSL)

    You should immediately change the root user's password in the
    "Users" section of the admin console.

    You can use a WebDAV client to view the user home directory
    workspace (same credentials as above):

        http://localhost:8080/home/
        https://localhost:8443/home/           (if you enabled SSL)


STANDALONE WEBAPP
=================

Future releases of Cosmo will provide a standalone webapp distribution
that you can deploy into an existing application server. Advanced
users should be able to do this today by examining the customized
config files in the Tomcat bundle distribution.


TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

 *** First read the Release Notes! ***

    You can find the release notes for Cosmo at
    $COSMO_HOME/docs/RELEASE_NOTES.txt. Please read them and become
    familiar with all of the known issues before asking for help. If
    your question is not answered there, check README.txt for mailing
    list and bug tracker information.


Common Gotchas:

    * If another process is listening on port 8080, you will need to
      change the port on which Tomcat's connector listens. Edit the
      Connector entry in $COSMO_HOME/tomcat/conf/server.xml and change
      the port attribute to specify a port that isn't in use (and that
      the user running the Cosmo server has the privilege to use):

        <Connector port="8080" enableLookups="false"/>

      If you are running another instance of Tomcat, you may also need
      to change this instance's shutdown port:

        <Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN">
