Cosmo Sharing Server 0.2.4
Release Notes
        

UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS RELEASE
=================================

Cosmo now requires Java 5.0 (sometimes called 1.5). No configuration
changes other than pointing $JAVA_HOME at a 5.0 JRE are required to
run Cosmo.

Due to changes in how Cosmo stores data into its embedded Derby
databases, 0.2.4 cannot operate against repositories created by
earlier versions of Cosmo.

The Tomcat configuration file ($COSMO_HOME/tomcat/conf/server.xml)
explicitly includes attributes for configuring the HTTP connector's
thread pool. These attributes can be easily rewritten manually or by
scripts to reconfigure the thread pool. See the Tomcat configuration
guide for more information on configuring the HTTP connector.


NEW FEATURES
============

Certain Cosmo features may be enabled/disabled/configured via
environment variables passed into the cosmoctl script. These
environment variables may be set in the user's environment before
running the script or in $COSMO_HOME/bin/cosmocfg. See that file and
the Cosmo Administrator's Guide for more information.

The web UI's admin console now has a "server status" page that shows
basic memory usage statistics pulled from the JVM. These statistics
can be dumped into a simple key/value text format for use by
monitoring tools. A button on the page allows garbage collection to be
triggered manually. The Cosmo Administrator's Guide has more details.

A new CMP "signup" operation has been added that allows programs
working on behalf of anonymous users to sign up for user accounts in
Cosmo. See the Cosmo Developer's Guide for more information.


BUGS FIXED
==========

4739: Jackrabbit no longer enters a deadlocked state under heavy
      load.
4740: Jackrabbit no longer creates large numbers of repository index
      files, causing the process file descriptor limit to be reached.
4742: The "home directories" page in the web UI now displays as
      expected.
4755: Derby has been upgraded to 10.1.2.1, fixing issues with database
      creation on OS X.
