Cosmo Sharing Server 0.2.3
Release Notes
        

UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS RELEASE
=================================

Since Cosmo's repository is now stored in an embedded Derby instance,
0.2.3 cannot operate against repositories created by earlier versions
of Cosmo.


BUGS FIXED
==========

4561: To avoid OutOfMemoryExceptions, Cosmo should be started with
      JAVA_OPTS="-Xmsxxxm -Xmxyyym" to allocate more memory to the
      JVM.
4616: CMP and DAV requests no longer cause HTTP sessions to be created
4620: GET responses for resources that do not exist correctly return
      404 responses
4663: Cosmo no longer stores iCalendar properties and parameters
      directly in JCR, and it uses an embedded Derby instance as the
      repository data store
