Client Development - Sessions


Overview
========

Cosmo responses often include a JSESSIONID cookie. When Cosmo receives
a request without that cookie it begins a new web session and attempts
to set the JSESSIONID cookie containing the new sesson's unique
identifier. WebDAV clients should ignore this cookie and assume a
stateless conversation with Cosmo as normal.
