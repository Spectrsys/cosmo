LATER RELEASES
==============

See "Deferred Features" section of the 0.2 Spec at
<http://svn.osafoundation.org/server/cosmo/trunk/src/docs/spec/cosmo-0.2-spec.html>

 * support OPTIONS and PROPFIND requests for principal URLs
 * account activation
    o system generates email at signup containing activation url; user
      must click the url to confirm his address and activation his
      account before he can use the account
    o admin can auto-confirm users
 * move new user form to its own page
 * home directory browser
 * honor HTTP Accept header in case the client prefers text/html over
   text/calendar for calendar collections
 * jsp precompilation
 * see if we can't get Struts to work with "/user/bcm/update" rather
   than "/user/update.do" with "username=bcm" in content body
 * look into litmus failures
 * figure out how to make Acegi Security not cache the token if it
   doesn't authenticate or if access is denied. caching the token
   causes problems for clients that send the session cookie to the
   server (cadaver, browsers, etc.) - low priority since chandler does
   not deal with the session cookie
