To Do List


0.2 RELEASE
===========

See
<http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/ZeroPointTwoCosmoPlanning>
for current development plan. Additional tasks:

WebDAV:

CalDAV:

Tickets:
 * consider splitting security config into completely separate ones
   for ui and dav

UI:
 * precompile jsps for distribution
 * remove obsolete welcome page

General:
 * see if we can't get Struts to work with "/user/bcm/update" rather
   than "/user/update.do" with "username=bcm" in content body
 * final copy and format for mail messages
 * find a better way to specify configuration items than using j2ee
   environment entries
 * look into litmus failures
 * figure out how to make Acegi Security not cache the token if it
   doesn't authenticate or if access is denied. caching the token
   causes problems for clients that send the session cookie to the
   server (cadaver, browsers, etc.) - low priority since chandler does
   not deal with the session cookie
