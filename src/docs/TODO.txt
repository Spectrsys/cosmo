0.2 RELEASE
===========

See
<http://wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Journal/ZeroPointTwoCosmoPlanning>
for current development plan. Additional tasks:

 * final copy and format for mail messages
 * find a better way to specify configuration items than using j2ee
   environment entries
 * user error message for "email not unique"
 * find a way to tweak Acegi Security's run-as authz so that it
   doesn't refresh the SecureContext at the end of the account signup
   request, overwriting our automatic login and forcing the user to
   explicitly log in
 * precompile jsps for distribution
 * see if we can't get Struts to work with "/user/bcm/update" rather
   than "/user/update.do" with "username=bcm" in content body
 * look into litmus failures
